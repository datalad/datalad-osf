    """git-annex special remote for the open science framework

    Any OSF node can be used as a remote, but the
    recommended setup is to create a subcomponent of your project
    for archiving your data. Mark it with the Data category so you
    can find it quickly and take note of its URL. Each component
    (or project) has a URL like https://osf.io/6zbyf/ which is
    needed to connect to it.

    .. todo::

       Write doc section on how to do that, and what URL should be used to
       configure the special remote.

    Initialize the special remote::

       git annex initremote osf type=external externaltype=osf \\
            encryption=none node=<your-component-id>

    To upload files you need to supply credentials.

    .. todo::

       Outline how this can be done

       OSF_USERNAME, OSF_PASSWORD - credentials, OR
       OSF_TOKEN   # TODO: untested, possibly currently broken in osfclient.

    Because this is a special remote, the uploaded data do not retain the
    git folder structure.

    The following parameters can be given to `git-annex initremote`, or
    `git annex enableremote` to (re-)configure a special remote.

    `node`
       the OSF URL of the file store

    `path`
       a subpath with (default: /)

    .. seealso::
